## VedicConnect
The e-learning platform, VedicConnect, provides an interactive environment for students and instructors, seamlessly combining online learning tools with user-friendly functionality. Instructors can upload course notes, allowing students organized access to materials for each class. The platform integrates Zoom for live, real-time sessions, supporting dynamic interaction and learning continuity.
